The first release from the LibreTime Community.

## Features

- Working installer for Debian and Ubuntu
- Automated Vagrant setup for developers on either Debian, Ubuntu or CentOS
- Removed visible legacy upstream branding
- Disable most legacy upstream "pro" SaaS integrations
- "pro" widgets for everyone
- AutoDJ support for shows
- Tons of bugfixes like working silan cue cuts and more

The complete LibreTime documentation is available at [libretime.org](http://libretime.org).

Since this is an alpha release there will be bugs in the code. Some features that went missing in legacy upstreams "pro" branch have been backported while others are still waiting for such treatment. Please report any issues and/or feature requests in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/issues).

The attached debian package is considered unstable as it has not had any serious testing at all. It mainly demonstrates that we are able to build one.
