## :arrow_up: Upgrade

### Analyzer certificate verification

Analyzer no longer ignore certificate verification when performing a request. We recommend using Let's Encrypt to get a certificate. If you do rely on self signed certificate, please read the [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/) documentation to provide a CA Bundle to verify the cert using environment variables.

### Analyzer new command line interface

The Analyzer command line interface has been reworked and uses new flags / environment variables for configuration.

- `--debug` flag becomes `--log-level <level>`
- `--rmq-config-file` flag becomes `--config <filepath>`
- `--http-retry-queue-file` flag becomes `--retry-queue-filepath`.
- `retry-queue-filepath` default value changed from `/tmp/airtime_analyzer_http_retries` to `retry_queue` in the working directory.
- `LIBRETIME_CONF_DIR` environment variable was replaced with `LIBRETIME_CONFIG_FILEPATH`.

### New configuration schema

The Playout configuration schema has been changed like the following:

- the top section 'pypo' was renamed to 'playout'
- the 'playout.ls*\*' entries were renamed to 'playout.liquidsoap*\*'
- the 'playout.\*\_dir' entries were removed
- the 'playout.api_client' entry was removed
- the 'playout.record_file_type' entry was renamed to 'playout.record_file_format'
- the 'playout.base_recorded_files' entry was removed
- the 'playout.poll_interval' entry was removed
- the 'playout.push_interval' entry was removed
- the 'playout.cue_style' entry was removed

Please see the [configuration documentation](../admin-manual/setup/configuration.md) for more details.

### API environment variables

The API environment variables names changed:

- `LIBRETIME_CONF_DIR` was removed
- `LIBRETIME_CONF_FILE` was renamed to `LIBRETIME_CONFIG_FILEPATH`

### Log files new paths

When running Playout from the command line, the service will not log to a file by default.
When running Playout as a systemd service, the log file moved from `/var/log/airtime/pypo/pypo.log` to `/var/log/libretime/playout.log`

The Playout Notify log file at `/var/log/airtime/pypo-liquidsoap/notify.log` was removed and merged into the existing `/var/log/libretime/liquidsoap.log` log file.

When running Liquidsoap from the command line, the service will not log to a file by default.
When running Liquidsoap as a systemd service, the log file moved from `/var/log/airtime/pypo-liquidsoap/ls_script.log` to `/var/log/libretime/liquidsoap.log`

The Legacy log file moved from `/var/log/airtime/zendphp.log` to `/var/log/libretime/legacy.log`

The API log file moved from `/var/log/airtime/api.log` to `/var/log/libretime/api.log`

Run the following command to clean the old directory:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/log/airtime
```

### Services new working directories

When running Playout as a systemd service, the working directory changed from `/var/tmp/airtime/pypo/` to`/var/lib/libretime/playout`. When running from the command line, the users current working directory is now used by default.

When running Liquidsoap as a systemd service, the working directory is now `/var/lib/libretime/playout`. When running from the command line, the users current working directory is now used by default.

When running Analyzer as a systemd service, the working directory is now `/var/lib/libretime/analyzer`.

Run the following command to clean the old directory:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/airtime/pypo/
```

### Analyzer new `ffmpeg` based steps

The Analyzer now requires `ffmpeg`. The `silan` system dependency and the `rgain3` python package and it's system dependencies can be removed.

Run the following command to clean the old packages:

```bash
sudo apt purge silan

sudo apt uninstall \
    gir1.2-gtk-3.0 \
    libcairo2-dev \
    libgirepository1.0-dev \
    libglib2.0-dev \
    pkg-config \
    python3-cairo \
    python3-dev \
    python3-gi \

    python3-gst-1.0
sudo pip3 uninstall rgain3
```
