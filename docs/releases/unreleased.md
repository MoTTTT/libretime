## :arrow_up: Before upgrading

:::caution

Please follow this **before the upgrade procedure**!

:::

### File based stream configuration

The stream configuration moved from the database to the [configuration](../admin-manual/setup/configuration.md#stream) file. A configuration sample can be found in the project folder under `installer/config.yml`. Make sure to save your existing stream config to the configuration file.

:::info

To prevent accidental data loss during upgrade, the stream configuration data will only be removed from the database in future releases. You can view the data using the following commands:

```bash
sudo -u libretime libretime-api dbshell --command="
    SELECT *
    FROM cc_stream_setting
    ORDER BY keyname;"

sudo -u libretime libretime-api dbshell --command="
    SELECT *
    FROM cc_pref
    WHERE keystr IN (
        'default_icecast_password',
        'default_stream_mount_point',
        'live_dj_connection_url_override',
        'live_dj_source_connection_url',
        'master_dj_connection_url_override',
        'master_dj_source_connection_url'
    )
    ORDER BY keystr;"
```

### Timezone configuration

The timezone preference moved from the database to the [configuration](../admin-manual/setup/configuration.md#general) file. Make sure to save your existing timezone preference to the configuration file.

:::info

To prevent accidental data loss during upgrade, the timezone preference will only be removed from the database in future releases. You can view the data using the following commands:
